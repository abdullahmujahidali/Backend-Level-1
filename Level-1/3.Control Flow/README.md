This README file contains control flow based questions which are solved using Python language.

### Question No 1:
#### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What is the difference between 10 / 3 and 10 // 3?

### Answer No 1:


### Question No 2:
#### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  What is the result of 10 ** 3?

### Answer No 2:
The result of ` 10 ** 3` is 1000. As ** operator in terms of mathematical computation means power operator where the value before operator is the base and the value after the operator is the power of that base. So here the piece of code means 10 power 3 which is 1000.

### Question No 3:
#### &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Given (x = 1), what will be the value of after we run (x += 2)?

### Answer No 3:
The result of `(x +=2) ` when `(x=1)` will be 3. It is because we are pre-incrementing the value of x with 2. Previously we initialized the value of x with 1. So after pre-incrementing the value when we print the new value of x we get <b> 3 </b> as answer.
